# coursera-getting-and-cleaning-data-project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

The script will download the dataset into the working directory
Loads the activity and feature related data
Loads the training and test datasets
Loads the activity and subject data and merges these data columns with the dataset
The script merges the two datasets
Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
